Astra is a modified version of Adonis by Sceleratis with edits, patches, and more!
## Installation
### TODO: Update the section below.<br>
<br>If you get stuck, feel free to ask for assistance in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YqCfhnqRvP).

### Method 1 (recommended): Official Roblox Model

1. [Take a copy](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/89984488815661/Astra-Admin-Loader) of the Adonis loader model from the Roblox Library.
2. Insert the model into Studio using the Toolbox, and place it under `ServerScriptService`. (Do not leave it in the `Workspace`!)

### Method 2: GitHub Releases

* Download the `rbxm` file snapshot from the [latest release](https://github.com/Astra-Corporation/Astra.Admin/releases/latest)
* Import the model file into Studio
  * Note: By default, snapshots included in releases have <a href="#debug-mode">`DebugMode`</a> enabled.

### Method 3: Filesystem

* Download the repository to your computer's file system
* Install and use a plugin like [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) to compile Adonis into a `rbxmx` file
  * If using Rojo, you can run `rojo build /path/to/adonis -o Adonis.rbxmx` to build a `rbxmx`
* Import the compiled model file into Studio
  * Note: By default, loaders compiled from the repository have <a href="#debug-mode">`DebugMode`</a> enabled. **This method compiles the _bleeding edge_ version of Adonis, which may be unstable.**

## Debug Mode

The Adonis loader provides a `DebugMode` option which will load a local copy of the `MainModule` rather than fetching the latest version. This could be useful if you want to stay on a particular version of Adonis or want to maintain a custom version for your game. Debug mode expects the `MainModule` to share the same parent with the loader model (e.g. both should be in `ServerScriptService`). **By default, snapshots provided in  releases have `DebugMode` enabled.**

### Toggling debug mode

* Open `Astra_Loader` > `Loader` > `Loader`
* Change `DebugMode` at the end of the `data` table to the desired value (e.g. `DebugMode = false`)
